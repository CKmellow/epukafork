🌦️ Epuka — Early Weather Warning & Response System

Epuka is a web-based platform designed to help communities in Kenya prepare for and respond to extreme weather events such as floods, droughts, and heavy storms.
Built with React, the platform focuses on awareness, preparedness, and community-driven response through real-time weather updates and user reports.

🚀 Overview

Extreme weather conditions continue to threaten lives and livelihoods across Kenya. Epuka aims to bridge the information gap by offering a centralized platform where users can:

Access up-to-date weather information

Receive early warnings for extreme weather events

Share reports or updates from affected areas through a chat-like feature

Stay informed about safety tips and emergency response contacts

Although the chat/reporting feature was simulated during development, it demonstrates how the system could be used to crowdsource ground-level information during emergencies.

💡 Features

Weather Dashboard: Displays current conditions and forecasts for different regions.

Early Warnings: Provides alerts about potential extreme weather events.

Community Reporting (Simulated): Allows users to post updates or report weather impacts.

Informational Resources: Offers preparedness guides, emergency contacts, and safety tips.

🌍 Target Audience

The platform is designed for the general public, especially residents in regions prone to floods or droughts, to help them access early alerts and contribute reports that can assist others.

🔮 Future Improvements

Integrate real-time chat and reporting backend

Add geolocation-based alerts

Develop a mobile-friendly version

Integrate AI/ML models for early weather anomaly predictions

Enable connection with official disaster response teams
